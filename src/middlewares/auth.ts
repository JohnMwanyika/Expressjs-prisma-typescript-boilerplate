/**
 * A callback function used to verify user authentication and authorization.
 *
 * @param req - The request object, which will be augmented with the authenticated user.
 * @param resolve - A function to call when the verification is successful.
 * @param reject - A function to call when the verification fails.
 * @param requiredRights - An array of rights required to access the resource.
 * @returns An asynchronous function that processes the authentication and authorization logic.
 *
 * The inner function takes the following parameters:
 * - `err`: Any error that occurred during authentication.
 * - `user`: The authenticated user object or `false` if authentication failed.
 * - `info`: Additional information about the authentication process.
 *
 * The function performs the following:
 * 1. Rejects the request with an `UNAUTHORIZED` error if there is an error, no user, or additional info indicating failure.
 * 2. Assigns the authenticated user to `req.user`.
 * 3. Checks if the user has the required rights to access the resource.
 * 4. Rejects the request with a `FORBIDDEN` error if the user lacks the required rights and is not the owner of the resource.
 * 5. Resolves the request if all checks pass.
